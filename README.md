Primary Authority Register (PAR) Cypress Automation Test

## Overview

The PAR Cypress Automation Tests project is designed to automate the testing of the Primary Authority Register (PAR) application.
This repository includes frameworks and test scripts for **UI**, **API**, and **Accessibility** testing, ensuring comprehensive coverage of functional and non-functional requirements.

## Key Features
- **UI Testing:** Automated end-to-end tests for validating user workflows using **Cypress** and **Cucumber (BDD)**.
- **API Testing:** Automated API tests to validate RESTful services using Cypress `cy.request()`.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Integrated **Axe Core with Cypress** to ensure web content meets **WCAG 2.2 standards**.

## Tools and Technologies
- [**Cypress**](https://www.cypress.io/): For modern end-to-end and API testing.
- [**Cucumber Preprocessor**](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor): For behavior-driven development (BDD) and human-readable test scenarios.
- [**Cypress Axe**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-axe): For accessibility testing against **WCAG 2.2** standards.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing the test scripts.
- [**Mochawesome**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome): Custom reporting for test results.
